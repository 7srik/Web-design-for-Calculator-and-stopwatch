# Stopwatch Web Application

## Overview

This is a single-page web application that functions as a stopwatch. It features a timer displayed in "HH:MM:SS" format, along with buttons to start, stop, and reset the timer. Additionally, there's a date picker allowing you to select dates.

## Elements and Functionality

### Timer Display

- A label element displays the elapsed time in "HH:MM:SS" format.
- Initially, the timer displays "00:00:00."

### Date Picker

- An input field of type "date" allows you to select a date.
- It is disabled by default but can be enabled when the timer is stopped.

### Buttons

- **Start**: Begins the timer. The button becomes disabled once the timer starts.
- **Stop**: Pauses the timer. The button becomes disabled once the timer is paused.
- **Reset**: Resets the timer to "00:00:00." This button is disabled until the timer is started.

## CSS Styling

- The application uses basic CSS for styling, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Buttons change color on hover for a more interactive feel.
- Disabled buttons appear greyed out, and the text is crossed out to indicate their state.

## JavaScript

- The JavaScript code (in `index.js`) handles the timer functionality using asynchronous methods, including `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.
- The timer starts, stops, and resets based on button clicks, and the time is updated in real-time.
- It also manages the interaction of buttons and the date picker.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You can start, stop, and reset the timer using the respective buttons.
3. The date picker allows you to select different dates.
4. Enjoy using the stopwatch!
